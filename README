Github (I should really ask for an account on only9fans or run a local version)
complains unless there is a README.  I imported this from khm's Mercurial repo,
and he didn't include a README.  Now it has a README.

This is an IRC client in two parts:  a /srv interface and an interactive client
that uses the /srv interface.  It runs on Plan 9.  It's a really comfortable
client (though it has a couple of quirks).  khm wrote it, I added some bloat.
